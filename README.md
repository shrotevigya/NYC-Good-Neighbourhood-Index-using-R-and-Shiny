NYC: Good Neighborhood Index
Introduction
If you are looking to buy a new house or want to move to better neighborhood, we can help you making an informed decision. Our Aim with this project is to rank all 42 NYC Neighborhoods on the basis of Safety, Hygiene, Road Sense and Other amenities such as schools, hospitals, subways etc.
The Project is divided into two parts. In the first part we want  to show you interesting insights from NYC crime, 311 calls, NYC motor vehicle and 4 more datasets so that user can know what to expect from this Magnificent City. The second part deals with user preference, we have designed a shiny app through which user can rate his preference with factors like Crime, Hygiene, Road sense and other amenities. Based on userâ€™s rating, we will give you top 5 Neighborhoods that most suits your requirement.
Users will have to rate factors from 1 to 4. So you can rate safety as 4 and you think you do not care about other amenities that much, you can rate it as 3, Based on that we will provide you the best suited neighborhoods to you.
